# Handle bounds 

# Fitness
# Selection
    # Elitism ratio
        percentage of population kept to next generation [0, 1]
        critical performance on algorithm convergence
# Crossover
    - uniform crossover
    - modified crossover using 
    b1 = rand() => keep random during each iteration
    child1 = b1*parent1 + (1-b1)*parent2
    child2 = (1-b1)*parent1 + b1*parent2
# Mutation
